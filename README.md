# Analyze A/B Test Results

### Description
The background of this project is that a company has developed a new web page to try to increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal for this analysis is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Required Libraries
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodel`
